## How to contribute
There are many ways you can contribute, see below.

#### Found a bug?
Open an issue to report bugs. If you intend to write a patch, ensure the PR includes the relevant issue number. 

#### Do you intend to add/change a feature or fix a bug?
Pull requests are very welcome. Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.

Thanks!
